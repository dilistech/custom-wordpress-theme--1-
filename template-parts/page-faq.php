                <h3>What do your websites cost?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>The short answer: Our prices depend on so many factors, it’s impossible to say in one sentence. Avoid any web developer who can answer this question without a long talk.

                    The long answer: To get a better idea of the cost of what you want to build, give us a quick phone call. We’ll ask you a few questions about the nature of the site, what sort of interactivity the site will have, your graphic design needs, etc. Then we’ll be able to give you a ballpark figure. If you’re still interested, we’ll come to your place of business and come up with a firm quote.

                    If you talk to a web developer who gives you an instant quote, run away! Imagine telling someone you want a car and having them immediately giving you a price for that car. Any fair and honest car salesperson would want to know the make, model and engine type of the car you’re looking to purchase, right? The same goes for building web sites. Depending on the features you want for your web site, the cost can be anywhere from a few thousand Naira to a few million.</p>

                <h3>What can you help me with?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    With whatever we can. Preparing cost analysis, establishing team roles, creating roadmaps. Defining business goals, key business values, target users, main features, prioritising. We can find you similar projects that are already active on the market to benchmark against. We can assist you with creating user personas, mock-ups, user stories, time frame, establishing project status and preparing project estimation. We'll be happy to outline project specification, prepare wireframes, details concerning integrations with external services, API documentation, required features list.

                    In terms of project development we prepare server-side architecture, front end, back end, graphic and UX design, and create back-office consoles.

                    We are also happy to advise our customers in terms of budgeting, scheduling, risk management, and business model creation.

                <h3>How do I create a product with you?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    If you have an idea contact us by our online form, e-mail or phone. We'll meet and talk it over. Just be sure to prepare as much info about your idea as possible, it will smoothen the meeting and benefit further cooperation. If you don't know how to get around to it, go ahead and read our blog entry on how to write a project brief.

                <h3>What do I need to know before contacting you?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    Well, the most important thing to know is what do you want to accomplish. Why do I need this software? What for? What should it do? Having a clear vision in mind is crucial when ordering a software application. You don't want to spend many months developing it with us without being sure what you need. If you have no experience in web development feel free to read our blog entry on that topic. We'll also be glad to help you get started, building projects from scratch is nothing new for us.

                <h3> Do I need to be tech-savvy to cooperate with you and order a software application?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
               <p>
                   You certainly do not have to be a software development expert, that's what we're here for :) We welcome your experience in that matter if you happen to have any, but are prepared to guide you through the whole process and explain everything. Focus on your needs and we'll deliver what you require.

               </p>

                <h3> How much time will it take for you to make my website?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    To give you a precise answer we must prepare a project scope and create a budget. We shall tell you how much of that scope can be completed within the budget and we'll be able to estimate how long will it take after at least 2 weeks of work. Don't worry, if you're not happy with our work after two weeks you can retract from the project with no penalties, this is our trial period and we believe that any reliable software house should give you one.

                </p>

             <div>
                <h3>How do you guarantee product quality?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    We evaluate the result after every two weeks, we test our work (we conduct both development and acceptance tests), we present it to you, we apply your feedback so you know you get what you are paying for.

                </p>
              
            </div>
             <div>
                <h3>How can I be sure you work at my project as much as you declare?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    We thoroughly monitor our developers and control how much time they spend on each task down to the exact minute. We use Harvest software and Redmine to track time spent on your project.

                </p>

                <h3>I want to be involved in the website development process, do you have a problem with that?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    Not at all! We want you to be sure you'll receive the product you desire. From the planning stage to each finished version, we invite you to evaluate and improve our work. Our philosophy is to work with the client, not merely finish given tasks. We are always ready to listen and communicate.

                </p>
              
            </div>
             <div>
                <h3>Why should I choose you and not hire my own software development team?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    Hiring your own software developers can be a really smart choice, however, recruitment process is time-consuming and the costs of keeping an in-house programming team are very high. You'll probably need to employ your own  software engineers sooner or later but hiring us can help you save a lot of money and time (which is basically the same in a business project).

                </p>
              
            </div>
             <div>
                <h3>What happens after you finish my website?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    Hopefully the website is exactly what you dreamed of :) But apart from delivering a finished product, we are happy to provide you with technical support and website maintenance should you need it. After all, we know our work inside out. Of course if you want to maintain the website by yourself the source code and all technical data is at your disposal, but even in that case, feel free to contact us if you need any help.

                </p>
              
            </div>            
             <div>
                <h3>Are you able to double the size of the team involved in the project if the need arises?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    Whether you want to expand your product or create a completely new one simultaneously, and then again focus only on one of your projects, we are always ready to adapt to your requirements. If the work is less intense team size can be reduced. When improvements need to be implemented fast, we can quickly assign additional team members to speed up each phase of the development process.

                </p>
              
            </div>
             <div>
                <h3>Will development include the creation of prototypes and demo versions that I can try out?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
               <p>
                   We would not call it exactly a demo version but using Agile Methodolgy compels us to create operating software as soon as possible and later just add next features along the process. Therefore, you'll be able to examine and test your software very early.

               </p>
              
            </div>
             <div>
                <h3>Will my observations concerning the prototypes be factored into the final version?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    Of course. Thanks to the Agile Methodology we are able to iterate the project during its development and include your feedback to improve the product as it is being created.

                </p>

                <h3>Can the software be upgraded in the future as new technology becomes available?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    Of course! We are always happy to improve, upgrade and further develop our work.
                </p>

                <h3>What if I come to you with a product that I want to improve?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    We’ll be more than happy to help you with that. Beginning with a UX Audit (if applicable) through improving your system architecture and adding new features.

                <h3> Will a project manager be assigned to me as a contact person? Will this contact person be available throughout the time the software is being developed?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
               <p>
                   Yes. All our customers are assigned a liaison that serves as their guide and information source throughout our whole cooperation.

               </p>
              
            </div>
             <div>
                <h3>Will my liaison send me a progress report on a daily basis detailing the work that has been completed? What other pieces of information will they update me on? Will the progress report include a plan for the next sprint?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>                    
                  We send you a report every two weeks (i.e. after each sprint, when the next version of the software is completed) or every month if you prefer. The report includes info on what we plan to achieve in the next sprint. Apart from that you are welcome to contact us any time either in person, via Skype, phone, e-mail or live chat. During work hours we usually answer after no more than few minutes.

                <h3>What technology do you use?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
               <p>
                   For back-end we use .Net, For front-end we use Angular.js, and React.js. we create static websites with blog with wordpress since its the most popular cms.

               </p>
              
            </div>
             <div>
                <h3> Are there any reasons why you chose those particular technologies?</h3><span id="arrow" class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                <p>
                    
                    We use .Net because it works well when it comes to rapid application development, this framework works on 
                    object-oriented programming which eliminates unnecessary codes and it involves less code for the developer,
                     .Net consist of re-usable codes and many re-usable components. This translate into less time and consequently 
                     less cost to develop web applications,
                     .Net offers enhanced application security, .Net allows develoapers to develoap applications accross platforms and languages.


                    Front-end
                    React.js is a library. We use it because it is perfect for a wide range of projects, fast iterations, implementations, prototyping and creating a proof of concept. It’s simple and scalable. 

                    We choose Angular.js when it comes to enterprise projects. It’s a framework best suited for CRMs, CMS’ and other sophisticated apps and systems.
