                            fulfill. I.e., what its purpose is.</p>

                        <p> Once we know the site's goals, we can define the scope of the project. I.e., what web pages
                            and features the site requires to fulfill the goal, and the timeline for building those out.
                        </p>

                        <p> With the scope well-defined, we can start digging into the sitemap, defining how the content
                            and features we defined in scope definition will interrelate.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Now that we have a bigger picture of the site in mind, we can start creating content for the
                            individual pages, always keeping search engine optimization (SEO) in mind to help keep pages
                            focused on a single topic. It's vital that you have real content to work with for our next
                            stage:</p>

                        <p>With the site architecture and some content in place, we can start working on the visual
                            brand. Depending on the client, this may already be well-defined, but you might also be
                            defining the visual style from the ground up. Tools like style tiles, moodboards, and
                            element collages can help with this process.</p>
                    </div>

                            class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                        <p>By now, you've got all your pages and defined how they display to the site visitor, so it's
                            time to make sure it all works. Combine manual browsing of the site on a variety of devices
                            with automated site crawlers to identify everything from user experience issues to simple
                            broken links.</p>

                            class="fa fa-arrow-down"></span>
                        <p> Once everything's working beautifully, it's time to plan and execute your site launch! This
                            should include planning both launch timing and communication strategies — i.e., when will
                            you launch and how will you let the world know? After that, it's time to break out the
                            bubbly.</p>
